    Part one: HUNTING
</p> 
	
<p class="part1">
  I saw something last week and it was unnerving to say the least. I don't know what to do. I don't think I can talk to anyone about this so I'm going to write it here. I was hunting in the woods yesterday with my father, like we do every week, but something was different. The woods felt heavy. Like it was warning you not to go near. It felt like a funeral. But my father moved as if everything was normal so I figured I was making things up. We grabbed our hunting rifles and headed to our normal hunting spot. It was quiet but it was the normal quiet. Nothing crazy. I felt that maybe things were starting to get normal. Until I heard it. That god awful sound. It was buzzing. Like that sound when a fly is too close to your ear. Except it was too loud. It unnerved me. It sounded big. No fly could make that sound. No insect or bug for that matter. My father looked around. “You hear that?” he asked me. “Y-yeah.”  I said choking over my words already. The sound was getting quieter and further until eventually it was gone. There was this look on my fathers face, one I had never seen before. It was like worry mixed with fear but he was trying to hide it. I didn't think I would ever see my father scared. It worried me. Why did this sound scare him? He grabbed me. “Let's go back home,” he said, “something's not right.” We started walking back to the car. We walked in silence. But not the normal silence. It was awkward. It was like both of us wanted to say something but thought it would be better if we stayed quiet. I was getting dark now by the time we got back to our truck there was only a slither of light left in the sky. It was oddly calm and still. If this was any other night this silence would have been calming. However tonight was different. Me and my father put our rifles back into the truck. We both sat down nearly in unison. As my dad reached into his pocket to grab his keys another sound emanated from the woods. But it was different.

    Part two: MAGGOTS
</p>
<p class="part2">
 It sounded like maggots. Writhing is meat. Swishing their bodies through rot and decay. It was a horrid sound. It sounded like death. But there was another sound. It sounded like continuous gulping. GULP GULP GULP. My father stopped and looked around. He put his keys back into his pocket and got out of the car. I followed along. I grabbed my gun out the back of the truck just in case. Our movements were slow and cautious. The noise was coming from in front of us. We walked slowly. As we got closer to the sound I gave my gun to my father. He could do way more than I could with it. He locked and loaded the weapon making sure it was ready to fire. And that's when we saw it. It was a woman sitting over a body. The body jerked and twitched. Like a robot with a short circuit. With every jump more and more blood poured from the poor man. But that wasn't the worst of it. The woman sitting on the body was not human. She had a long pole-like structure coming out from the inside of her mouth. It was a proboscis, lodged into the chest of the poor man. GULP GULP. The “thing” was syphoning blood from the body every GULP made the man even more pale. BOOM!!! A loud sound rang out. My father had shot the creature. It was quiet. There was no movement and the woods went back to its normal silence. Well, as normal as it could have been. And then it happened. The moment that made this situation all the more hellish.

    Part three: MOSQUITO
</p>
<p class="part3">
    The creature got up. Stumbling. Like a zombie. It was horrific, and the smell, god the smell. It was like everything around us was rotting. The trees, the road, the body, the creature. They all smelled rotten. My father was reloading the gun. It was taking him longer than usual. He was shaking. The creature was now standing up. CRACK!! The creature's back started popping. It looked like a person was reaching out from inside the creature. Then the creature's back popped open and blood came rushing and gushing out. It was so much blood. An ocean of blood. Too much blood. BOOM!! My father shot the creature once more. It didn't even react. Wings expanded from its back. More blood splashes out. The wings began to flap. They were so fast. And the buzzing sound began. It was like a mosquito. The buzzing was so loud it was deafening. The wind from the insect-like wings picked up dirt from the road and threw it in all directions. I shielded my eyes and looked up. The creature was flying.
