    <p class="title1">
    Part one: Murder?
</p> 
<p class="part1">The Sierra County Police Department received a call this morning. It was around 8:30. A young man was on his daily jog when he came across a gruesome sight. A young woman. Dead. Police were dispatched immediately. When they arrived they took pictures of the body in an undisturbed state. She was a young woman no older than 20 and was tied to a tree. She was also pregnant. However, her stomach was ripped open. It looked as though something had crawled out. Something big. The police couldn't make heads or tails of the situation. How could something this big burst out of this young woman? Later on the police identified the young woman.

    Part two: Lisa Turner.
</p>
<p class="part2">Lisa Turner was her name. Turner was born in 2006 and grew up in Chicago. However, when she turned 6 her mother moved to Sierra County. She attended Kovak High School. Turner never did particularly well. She averaged D’s and F’s and never had many friends. She was extremely pale and looked sickly most of the time. This led to most of the children bullying her and calling her disgusting names. She was an outcast. Turner never seemed to mind. She liked being alone afterall. Turner spent most of her time in her room listening to music. She enjoyed her life. She woke up every day and followed the same routine. Wake up, go to school, come home, listen to music and sleep. It was repetitive and simple and she enjoyed it. Until one day she met a man. A strange young man.
