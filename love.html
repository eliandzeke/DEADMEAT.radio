    <p>This girl I loved. Her name was [censored]. Her life was like a rocky road and she never had any free time. It was horrible. I was always worried. She was always sick and it scared me. I never knew if she was alive or dead. She could hardly breathe. She was never in a good mood.  I missed her quite terribly. It weighed on me heavily. But I never could leave her. No matter what happened I loved her. Her cold grey eyes, her beautiful blue skin and the wonderful dirt under her finger nails. I missed her quite terribly. She always said the wrong thing. She never made me feel better. She made me cry. She made me want to die inside. It felt like she hated me. But no matter what she always said “I love you”. It felt fake. She only said it to make me feel better, to keep the small spark inside of me on fire. It worked. I loved her and I missed her quite terribly. The music she listened to made me feel sick. The way she danced was disgusting. Yet I always wanted to listen to her music. I always wanted to watch her dance. No matter how much it hurt, no matter how much it degraded me. I missed her quite terribly. We would barely talk. Except for the rare nights where she was free enough to call. We would stay up for hours talking about nothing. I wished those nights could have lasted forever. But they always passed. They passed so quickly and then we went back to being strangers. She went back to hating me. I went back to missing her quite terribly.</p>
